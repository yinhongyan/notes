# Concept

Folder Notes types. Difference between them - how "merge/archive" button works.


## Library

Library / Movies / Games / Files

Name arangment + release date + description

* Exolon (1987)
* Draconus (1988)

Archive/Merge: not working. Organize it manually.


## Subscription

News / Journal / Blog / RSS / subscription agregator. We are subscripbing to master folder.

Left pane - Date arranged. Right - content, you can click to show including subfolders.

Some one shared it's own notes. He can fill up folder with data entered different ways.
He can enter:

* type texts manual, plain or rich
* manual adding pictures, files, music podcasts.
* clip html content using browser plugin. including youtube video.
* RSS subscription
  * RSS filters can be applied, to cut part of html, parse, extract urls, expand or download additional html, images or videos. per site / RSS filter bases.

Archive/Merge: Master able to merge items / folders by calling 'Merge' button on few items. Items merged into a folder will change the folder name accordenly. If we merge [2015-01-01 11:11.png] && [2015-01-01 12:11.png] - result will create [2015-01-01] folder with files it contains. We can merge hours / days / months / years / centuries. Also if here a gap between years. like merging [2011] && [2015], folder should be named like this: [2011,2015]. Merging [2010] && [2011] && [2012] && [2015], will produce [2010-2012,2015]. Same with months, days, hours.

Content captured to host's folder. Content keep's original URL. And have page content reference (which part of page were taken). It can be edited or altered by host (removing ads).

* [Folder ID: folder1]
  * [Folder ID: folder1-1]
content: RSS url1
  * [Folder ID: folder1-2]
content: RSS url2

Encruption: Folder can be encrypted, shared content will be shared encrypted. And only subscriber who has a key can decrypt it. Here is only one key pairs. All subscribers has one key to decrupt content. Every month/year new content will be encrypted with new key.

Share: You can share whole folder or individual item with. Every shared item has GUID - global unique ID, cypto strong (act as a public key).

Subscriber, can subscribe for a full folder. Or choose ways to subscribe:
* recent 10 records
* recent 30 days
* recent 30 MB
* actual records (host decive what is actual)
* full subscription
