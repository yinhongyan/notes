# notes

Notes project. Idea is to have file system based notes cross platform p2p application. When you make a note on smartphone you want to get this same note on your notebook, and be able to share this note with your friends in your personal p2p network.

This project can be used as personal private encypted network, where you can note simple text files, images, movies, youtube links, playlists with offline access and ignores country based restrictions.

Adding some encyption key locking mechanisms, using bitcoin as subscription based distributed content - can make this network new content disctribution system above everying else currently on web.

P2P mecanics will allow you to backup your notes on any remote, local, paid, free, server having just a folder global id.
